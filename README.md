# Quantum-Challenge by Deloitte
Hello everybody,
this is team Quantimize's contribution to the Quantum Climate Challenge by Deloitte.
In this repository you can find all our code we produced during the challenge.

You can find a file called \textbf{requirement.txt}, which provides all the packages necessary to run our code. 

The folder Quantimze contains all the functions we have written.It is devided into parts, which are relevant only for our classical solution, only for our quantum solution or for both, like the data extraction, process and access or the safety check.

Our classical solution is a genetic algorithm inspired by the paper "Air traffic simulation in chemistry-climate model EMAC 2.41: AirTraf 1.0" written by Hiroshi Yamashita et al. It is used to benchmark our quantum algorithms.

We have to quantum algorithm: a Quantum Neural Network and a Quantum Genetic Alhorithm. Both can be found in the folder Quantimize/quantum.

The \textbf{main.py} is our main program, which wrappes everything up. Here you can find our final classical and quantum solution. And a benchmark on their performance.
