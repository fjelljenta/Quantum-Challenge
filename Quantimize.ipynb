    "The data preparation is all related to the file \"create_json_data.py\". It can be used as a standalone application to convert all three given files (atmospheric data, flight data, flight list) into the corresponding \\*.json files. This was done to get a better handle over the files and to adapt the access to our purposes. For example, some flight levels were converted from hPa to FL for simpler calculations and visualisations. Requirement for the file to run, is that there has to be a folder \"data\" (like in this project) in the current working directory. Also the files need to have the specific names for successful conversion. Further explanaition can be found in the file itself. We now want to concentrate more on the work we did."
