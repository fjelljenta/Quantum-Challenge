Classic solution algorithm
==========================

The classic solution consists mainly of the genetic algorithm (GA), because a straight line is not as effective as this approach. The GA functions consists of:

.. automodule:: quantimize.classic.classic_solution
    :members:

While the ``run`` function is the starting point for this algorithm.
