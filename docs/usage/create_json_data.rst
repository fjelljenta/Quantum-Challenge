Creation of JSON data
=====================

This section is dedicated to creating JSON files out of the data given, so the access in Python can be simplified. Therefore our code offers different conversion functions, namely:

.. automodule:: quantimize.create_json_data
    :members:

For the functions to work, there need to be a folder called data and the file names are also hard coded, which means, they need to match the original description.
