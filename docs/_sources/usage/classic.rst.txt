How to use classic functions and algorithms
===========================================

This part describes the classic algorithms and its functions. The classic algorithms consist of a simple straight line trajectory or great circle trajecotry and a trajectory calculated from a genetic algorithm (GA) approach with the help of some functions to create the trajectory from boundary points which the algorithm calculated.
Another part of this is the calculation of the cost or respectivly the impact on the environment. For more details see the following.
