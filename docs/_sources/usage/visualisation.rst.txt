Visualisation
=============

The visualisation covers almost everything regarding flight trajectory or atmospheric data plotting. There are 2D and 3D functions as well as animated ones.
Especially highlighted should be the functions ``plot_flight_path_on_3d_map_with_atmo_as_points`` and ``plot_flight_path_on_3d_map_with_atmo_as_slices``.

The general workingflow is to create a map object and then plot the trajectory on the map.
