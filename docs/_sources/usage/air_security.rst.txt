Air Security
============

The air security file covers all functions to check for the following requirements:

- minimum in plane distance of at least 5nm
- minimum out of plane distance of at least 10 FL
- no turns tighter than 25Â°
  
The file provides a method for each category and one for a combination. It also recalculates the trajectories on issues that arise, if the conditions above are not met.
